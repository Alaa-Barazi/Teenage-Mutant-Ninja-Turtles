# Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles

We want to create an application that will help us order
pizza for all the turtles, the problem is that you can add
up to five toppings to a pizza

<br/>
<br/>
We want to create an interface that displays turtles cards and each
card will have a different turtle and a button list of the
toppings he likes to eat.
example: <br/>

When the user clicks on an topic it will be added to the
list of add topics below the cards.

If five pizza toppings have already been selected and
the user adds more, give him a message explaining that
he has reached the maximum possible.

If a pizza topping is already selected in the order,
present it to the user in a message
